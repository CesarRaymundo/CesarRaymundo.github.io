## Get to Know Me

Hi my name is Cesar Raymundo, I am a undergrad at Boise State studying Computer Science. I grew up in rural town in Eastern Oregon with a population less than 2000 and graduated with a class size less than **60**. I originally attended to go to a trade school for auto mechanics and just settle with that. But after discovering coding during my senior year in high school by looking up youtube videos and seeing what you can accomplish and discover with programming, I decided to change my goal. After that, I was determine to go to a university and study what I actually wanted to. Besides that, a few hobbies of mine are gaming, running, longboarding, and spending time with family.
